# This is the Rust <-> workerd integration crate. It provides utilities implemented in Rust and
# is exposed using cxx to avoid needing to build a C FFI binding manually in both Rust and C++.
#
# It also has some extra code to make sure loading multiple Rust libraries into workerd
# is safe (specifically, lol-html). See
# * https://github.com/adetaylor/cxx/blob/book/book/src/building.md#linking-the-c-and-rust-together
# * https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73632
# Basically we create a mega-crate that links in all our rust dependencies which is
# the best that we can do right now to avoid linkage issues.
